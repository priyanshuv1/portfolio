# Priyanshu Singh — GitHub Portfolio Knowledge Base

> **Purpose:** This is the evidence-backed knowledge source for the AI assistant embedded in Priyanshu Singh's portfolio.
>
> **Source:** Public GitHub repositories under `priyanshuv1`.
>
> **Important:** This document distinguishes verified implementation evidence from repository names/metadata and from features that are only planned. The AI must never invent a technology, feature, metric, deployment, job responsibility, or implementation detail that is not supported here.

---

## 1. AI ASSISTANT OPERATING RULES

The assistant represents Priyanshu's work.

### Grounding rules

1. Answer from this knowledge base first.
2. Prefer concrete implementation details over generic skill claims.
3. When a feature is backed by source code, explain **what was implemented and how**.
4. If a feature is only present in a README, describe it as documented rather than claiming source-level verification.
5. If a repository only proves that a technology is installed in `package.json`, do not claim that every feature of that technology was implemented.
6. Do not convert absence of evidence into a negative claim.
7. Do not invent metrics, users, performance numbers, production scale, client adoption, revenue, accuracy, or deployment status.
8. Do not claim backend/server-side pagination when the evidence only proves a frontend request such as `?page=...`.
9. Do not claim production readiness unless the project explicitly documents it and source evidence supports it.
10. When asked about a specific project, mention the repository and concrete implementation evidence.
11. When asked "what skills does Priyanshu have?", prioritize skills demonstrated across multiple repositories.
12. When a question is outside the knowledge base, say that the available project evidence does not contain enough information.
13. The portfolio repository is currently being actively integrated with AI. Do not describe the AI portfolio integration as a completed feature unless explicitly updated in this knowledge base.

### Answer style

- Be concise but technically specific.
- Use natural language, not a raw dump of technologies.
- For technical/interview questions, give implementation examples from the repositories.
- When useful, mention the project where the skill is demonstrated.
- Prefer:
  > "He implemented API-driven pagination in PrimeReactPagination: the page state is sent to the API, total count is consumed from the response, a dynamic page window is calculated, and selection is preserved across pages with a Set of IDs."
- Avoid:
  > "He knows pagination."

# 3. FEATURE-LEVEL SKILL EVIDENCE

These are the implementation-level capabilities that should be surfaced when relevant.

## Pagination

### PrimeReactPagination
Verified implementation:
- React state for current page.
- Fixed page size of 10.
- API request includes `?page=${pageNumber}`.
- Reads `result.data`.
- Reads `result.pagination.total`.
- Calculates total pages.
- Calculates a five-page visible page window.
- Previous/Next controls.
- Disabled navigation states.
- Entry range calculation (`showing X to Y of Z entries`).
- Loading and error state handling.
- PrimeReact DataTable.
- Multi-row selection.
- Selection persistence across pages using a `Set` of row IDs.
- Custom "select first N rows" interaction through an OverlayPanel.

**Important distinction:** this proves an API-driven frontend pagination implementation. It does not by itself prove the backend pagination implementation.

Source: `PrimeReactPagination/src/components/page.tsx`.

---

## Search, filtering and sorting

### Inventory Management System
`Products.tsx` and `useProductsPage.ts` implement:
- Search query state.
- Category filtering.
- Derived `filteredProducts`.
- Add product flow.
- Edit product flow.
- Delete product flow.
- Form open/close state.
- Submit handling.
- Sort direction toggle.
- Reusable `ProductForm`.
- Reusable `ProductTable`.

### Mail Inbox
`useEmails.js` implements:
- Search query state.
- 500ms debounced search.
- Search over subject, sender and message body.
- Memoized filtered results.
- Memoized selected email.
- Email selection state.

---

## Custom React hooks

Verified examples include:
- Inventory: `useAppNavigation`, `useInventory`, `useInventoryState`, `useProductForm`, `useProductsPage`, `useStockMovement`.
- Mail Inbox: `useEmails`, `useDebounce`, `useDarkMode`.
- AI Safety SOS: `useLogin`.
- Portfolio: React hooks for loader state, scroll detection, menu state and lifecycle management.

This is stronger evidence than simply listing "React Hooks" as a technology.

---

## State management

Verified approaches across projects:
- Local `useState` for page/component state.
- React Context for shared application state.
- Redux Toolkit / React Redux in projects such as Netflix GPT and the portfolio.
- `Set` for cross-page row-selection persistence.
- Derived state with `useMemo`.
- Callback stabilization with `useCallback`.
- Refs with `useRef` for persistent mutable values and browser resources.

---

- React Router DOM
- Redux Toolkit / React Redux
- Tailwind CSS
- Firebase
- Express
- Node.js
- Gemini API
- Fetch
- Lucide React

`package.json` verifies the dependencies above.

## AI implementation

`server/ai/gemini.js` contains a server-side Gemini integration.

Verified behavior:
- Sends a prompt to Google's Gemini `gemini-2.5-flash` endpoint.
- API key is read from `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- Requests a list of movie titles.
- Uses a low temperature (`0.1`) and output token limit.
- Parses Gemini response candidates and text parts.
- Splits generated text into movie titles.
- Removes numbered-list prefixes.
- Filters empty lines.
- Collects results and returns the first 10 titles.

## AI backend architecture

`server/index.js`:
- Express server.
- dotenv configuration.
- CORS middleware.
- JSON body parsing.
- `/api/ai` route mounting.
- Port configuration.

`server/routes/ai.js`:
- POST AI endpoint.
- Reads `prompt` from request body.
- Returns HTTP 400 when prompt is missing.
- Calls `aiSuggest(prompt)`.
- Returns `{ text }`.
- Catches AI errors and returns HTTP 500.

## Useful AI skills to surface

- LLM API integration
- Server-side AI orchestration
- Prompt construction
- Response parsing
- Error handling
- Environment-variable API-key management
- Frontend-to-backend AI request flow

## Do not overclaim

# 12. CURRENT PORTFOLIO — SEPARATE SNAPSHOT

> This section is intentionally separated because the portfolio itself is currently being extended with AI.

Repository: `portfolio`

## Current verified stack

- React 19
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router
- Redux Toolkit
- React Redux
- GSAP
- GSAP React
- GSAP ScrollTrigger
- Lenis
- Motion
- Three.js
- React Three Fiber
- Drei
- Howler
- Lucide React
- EmailJS

## Current application structure

The current `App.jsx` contains:
- Loader.
- Custom cursor.
- Smart header.
- Hero.
- About.
- Projects.
- Skills.
- Scroll video section.
- Experience.
- Contact.
- Audio player.
- Theme toggle.

## Navigation

The current header tracks:
- Home
- About
- Projects
- Skills
- Video
- Experience
- Contact

It detects the active section based on scroll position and changes header contrast depending on whether the current section is light or dark.

## Current interaction system

Verified:
- Smooth scrolling using Lenis.
- GSAP ticker integration with Lenis.
- GSAP ScrollTrigger registration.
- Fixed smart header.
- Scroll-based active section detection.
- Responsive desktop/mobile navigation.
- Mobile menu drawer.
- Custom cursor component.
- Loader gate before the main portfolio is displayed.
- Audio event triggered after loader completion.
- Theme toggle.

## Visual/creative engineering direction

The portfolio is not a generic static portfolio. Its current architecture already supports:
- cinematic transitions,
- scroll-driven interactions,
- custom cursor behavior,
- audio,
- theme-aware navigation,
- smooth scrolling,
- GSAP-based motion,
- 3D capability through Three.js / React Three Fiber.

## AI integration status

The AI portfolio integration is an active work-in-progress. The current backend now has a verified RAG foundation, but the complete portfolio AI experience is not treated as finished.

The intended AI experience is a custom visual interaction integrated into the portfolio rather than a generic chatbot widget.

### Current RAG foundation — verified in the portfolio repository

The current backend implementation provides a retrieval foundation for portfolio knowledge:

- portfolio_knowledge.md is the primary evidence-backed knowledge source.
- Priyanshu_Singh_Resume.pdf is also ingested as a separate source.
- Markdown is recursively chunked with overlap.
- Each chunk receives heading, category, content-type and project metadata.
- sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 generates 384-dimensional normalized embeddings.
- Qdrant stores the vectors using cosine similarity.
- Chunk IDs are deterministic, allowing re-ingestion to update existing knowledge instead of creating duplicate points.
- User queries are embedded with the same model and searched against Qdrant.
- Retrieval currently returns the top five results with a similarity threshold.
- Project metadata is resolved from explicit Markdown project headings rather than generic words such as "AI" or "portfolio".

This is evidence of a working vector-search/RAG retrieval foundation in the portfolio repository. It should not be described as a completed production AI assistant, agentic system, or production-scale RAG application. Groq answer generation, reranking, agent orchestration and streaming are separate later layers.

# 13. AI TRADING RESEARCH ASSISTANT

Repository: `AI-TRADING-RESEARCH`

## Overview

An internship prototype for turning an ambiguous natural-language market question into a structured experiment, running a deterministic backtest on synthetic data, and explaining the resulting evidence.

Primary demo question:
> "Does buying NIFTY after a sharp fall work?"

## Workflow

`ASK → CLARIFY → DEFINE → TEST → LEARN`

### ASK
Natural-language market research question.

### CLARIFY
AI identifies:
- User-provided information.
- Inferred information.
- Missing information.

Clarification questions are generated when required.

### DEFINE
AI creates a structured `Experiment` object.

### TEST
A deterministic TypeScript engine runs the experiment against a local synthetic CSV dataset.

### LEARN
AI receives the exact numerical results and interprets them without changing them.

## Architecture

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Next.js App Router
- TypeScript
- Zod
- Google Gemini
- Synthetic CSV data
- Deterministic TypeScript backtest engine.

## Important engineering decisions

- AI does not calculate the backtest statistics.
- Same inputs produce deterministic outputs.
- Assumptions are visible and editable.
- No silent fallback for unsupported thresholds/timings.
- Non-overlapping trades.
- Daily timeframe only.
- Unsupported filters are rejected.
- Synthetic data is clearly labeled.
- NIFTY index results are not presented as directly tradable performance.

## Strong skills demonstrated

- Structured AI workflows.
- Schema validation with Zod.
- AI clarification.
- AI-to-structured-data conversion.
- Deterministic business logic separated from AI.
- Experiment design.
- Backtesting logic.
- Explicit assumptions.
- Error/unsupported-case handling.
- Evidence-based AI interpretation.

- AI Safety SOS — TensorFlow.js audio model + browser speech recognition + device motion.
- AI Trading Research — Gemini-based clarification/experiment workflow combined with a deterministic TypeScript backtest engine.
- Other AI-related repositories exist, but only describe their detailed functionality when evidence is added.

## "Has Priyanshu built backend systems?"

Yes.

Strongest evidence:
- Sales CRM: Node/Express/MongoDB/Mongoose/JWT/bcrypt/middleware/roles/API routes.
- SocialPost: Node/Express/MongoDB/JWT/bcrypt/Cloudinary.
- Netflix GPT: Node/Express AI backend.

## "Does he know performance optimization?"

Evidence includes:
- Mail Inbox virtualization using TanStack Virtual.
- Debounced search.
- `useMemo`.
- `useCallback`.
- `React.memo`.
- Overscan configuration.
- Portfolio Lenis + GSAP ticker integration.
- Lazy/conditional UI rendering patterns.

Do not invent benchmark numbers.

## "What makes the portfolio technically interesting?"

The current portfolio uses:
- GSAP.
- ScrollTrigger.
- Lenis.
- custom cursor.
- audio.
- theme-aware navigation.
- loader gating.
- responsive navigation.
- Three.js / React Three Fiber dependencies.
- motion libraries.

The AI layer is being added separately and should not be described as already complete.

# 19. FINAL AI INSTRUCTION

When answering about Priyanshu:

> Be a technically precise portfolio assistant. Use the project evidence in this document as the source of truth. Explain real implementations, not vague skill labels. When possible, connect a skill to the exact project and implementation pattern. Never invent missing details. If evidence is incomplete, explicitly say that the available repository evidence is insufficient. Treat current portfolio AI integration as work in progress unless this document is updated.
